        <h2><strong>Provably Zero-Trust</strong></h2>
        <p>
          Zero-Trust <em>without a proof</em> is no better than a pinky-promise.
        </p>

        <p>

          <strong>Sign and verify your own KMS components</strong> using your
          own keys. That way, you don't have to trust us or the
          <em>software supply chain</em> that we are using.

        <h2><strong>Composable KMS for AI pipelines</strong></h2>
        <p>
          Protect <em>your data</em> &mdash; not just the keys! Process
          (compose) encrypted data without exposing them to the cloud.
        </p>
        <p>
          Build your ETL/ELT pipelines while
          <strong>keeping your data always encrypted</strong>! Bring your own
          filtering, tokenization, and searchable encryption schemes and store
          your secrets in our high-fidelity KMS.
